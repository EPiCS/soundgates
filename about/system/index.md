## Editor
![Soundgates Editor](http://pc2.github.io/pg-soundgates/assets/images/system_editor.png)  
The Soundgates editor is the first step in the patch development. The user can add sound components from the XML library to the patch. For each sound component the user can decide if it will be implemented in hardware or in software. The sound components can be connected with each other via their ports. An additional editor allows creation of composite components which are hierarchical structures containing other sound components. These composite components can then be used in the patch editor as black boxes.  
A completed patch can be exported as a TGF file (included in a ZIP archive) that is read by the Soundgates synthesizer.
