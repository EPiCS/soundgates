# Quickstart
Head to [pg-soundgates/software/zynq/Binaries](https://github.com/pc2/pg-soundgates/tree/snapshot20032014/software/zynq/Binaries) and unpack the bundle for your platform.
Inside you will find a precompiled version of the Synthesizer program with all necessary libraries and a default selection of sound components. 

You may run the *patchStart.sh* script to unpack and run patches generated by the Eclipse editor. Doing so will create a working copy in your /tmp folder. 
Try it with the provided example patch that plays a sine with a constant frequency of 440 Hz: 

`./patchStarter.sh sin440.zip`.

If you get error messages regarding ALSA and you cannot hear any sound, you might need to adjust your device settings as described in the [config documentation]({{site.url}}/documentation/config). Note that the Synthesizer needs exclusive access to your soundcard, so you may have to close other programs that play sound.
