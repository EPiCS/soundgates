= Repository for the project group Soundgates



== Roadmap for the future

=== short-term

* Add event system such that nodes can receive events (e.g. topology changes, edge reconnected)
* Dynamically add sound nodes and connections to the synthesizer
* Improve support for pulse audio (and maybe jackd)
* Make more use of the rpc interface 
* Change internal sample format to avoid fixed point overflows


=== mid-term

* Refactor FPGA platform support
* Test project on other hardware platforms (e.g RaspberryPi, Microblaze, etc.)
* Add further and more complex audio processing components (FFT, Bandpass FIR/IIR)
* Make the synthesizer application be auto discoverable on the network
* Improve editor support

=== long-term

* Create a package that can be easily installed via package manager
* Add support for other operation systems (e.g. MacOS)
