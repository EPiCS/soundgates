The goal of the <em>Soundgates</em> project is to provide a framework that allows interactive music synthesis on x86 architectures and on modern FPGAs. <em>Interactive</em> means that several users can control the sound that is generated by means of advanced sensors, e.g. through motion and light sensors featured in todays smartphones. Music can be generated by creating a so called <em>patch</em> that is a network of sound components and executing this patch on a <em>Sythesizer</em>. An <em>Editor</em> for assembling the sound components together to an executable patch and a library of sound components such as frequency generators, envelope generators, modulators, mixers, filters and many more are provided. The Editor allows to simulate patches prior to executing it on the target platform. The Synthesizer either runs on a normal x86-based pc or on a FPGA platform. On FPGA platforms the Sythesizer might take advantage of hardware sound components that should reduce the load of the CPU that executes the patch.
