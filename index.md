> "Modern platform FPGAs integrate fine-grained reconfigurable
> logic with processor cores and allow the creation of complete
> configurable systems-on-chip. However, design methodologies
> have not kept up with the rise in complexity of the target
> hardware. In particular, there is little overlap between the
> programming model for embedded software running on a real-time
> operating system and the programming model for digital logic.
> In this paper, we present the operating system ReconOS which
> supports both software and hardware threads with a single unified
> programming model. ReconOS is based on eCos, a widely-used real-time
> operating system (RTOS). We investigate the incurred time and 
> area overheads, especially for inter-thread communication across
> the hardware/-software boundary, and present a case study
> demonstrating the feasibility of the RTOS-centric design approach."
