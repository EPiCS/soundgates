	\section{Product functions}
	We provide a graphical editor for the synthesizer development. The library of the editor offers components like sound generators, filters etc. which the designer can choose and connect to create an own synthesizer with specific sounds. Some components have attributes which can be modified in the editor. It is possible to create composed components by combining several components into one. Before exporting the system the designer can simulate the synthesizer and hear its sound. Furthermore the designer can define the interfaces of the system which are used for the interaction with the user.
The system developted in the editor can be exported as VHDL-code which is synthesized on a FPGA.

The user of the synthesizer (e.g. a musician) interacts with the mentioned interfaces without knowing about the internal structure of the system. E.g. he can connect a MIDI device and other devices to the FPGA to create the input.
