	\funcRequirement{1}
	{??}
	{Add component to a patch}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to add components to a patch.}
	{high}
	{--}
  \funcRequirement{2}
	{??}
	{Remove component from a path}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to remove components from a patch.}
	{high}
	{--}
  \funcRequirement{3}
	{??}
	{Modify attributes of a component}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to modify static parameters of a component.}
	{mid}
	{The value of static parameters, like the channel of an audio output interface, are only allowed to be changed during design time.}
	
	\funcRequirement{4}
	{??}
	{Add composite components}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to create composite components.}
	{mid}
	{The priority is classified as medium, because a correct patch could be created without composite components. }
	
	\funcRequirement{5}
	{??}
	{Add port to a composite component}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to add a port to a composite component.}
	{mid}
	{Only composite components can have user defined ports. Ports of atomic components are fixed, such they cannot be added, removed or modified.}
	
	\funcRequirement{6}
	{??}
	{Connect Components via Links}
	{The soundgate designer user should be able to connect ports of multiple components.}
	{high}
	{The soundgate designer user can should be ablte to connect an outport of a component to in inport of another component. All other combinations are invalid.}
