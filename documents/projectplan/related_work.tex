\section{Cycling '74 Max}
	Our editor is in some way similar to other music composition applications especially cycling74's MAX. Also it offers a drawing canvas, which can be filled with connected components. At any time the patch, which of the combination of every used component, can be simulated to hear the generated sound. However, this covers only the simulation part of our entire system. These components can be exported as a combination of VHDL code and prepared netlists in order to create a bitfile to generate that sound live on a FPGA. Furthermore it is possible to change the behavior of some components at runtime my manipulating their input values through different sensors. \\
