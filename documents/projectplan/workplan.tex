\chapter{Workplan}
We are developing our system in an agile development process. Therefore we created different milestones, which are based on Use-Cases. Every milestone represents a functionally working version of our whole system whereas the last milestone includes every single functionality. Testing is also done in between those milestones to guarantee a working system. 

\section{Milestones}
Mention our different milestones with their due dates. A Gantt Diagram would be fancy as hell.
