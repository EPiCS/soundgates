	\section{About this document}
	This document is the project plan of the project group ``Soundgates'' at the University of Paderborn. 
	It introduces the topic of our project group in Chapter \ref{chapter:Introduction} and the goals we want to achieve in Chapter \ref{chapter:Goals}.
	Chapter \ref{chapter:RelatedWork} covers systems similar to what we are going to create, escpecially the software called MAX.
	Chapters \ref{chapter:Organization} and \ref{chapter:Workplan} describe how the group will organize itself and the groups' milestones.

	Not only should this document serve as a basis for the later evaluation and grading by our professor, but also as a reference for our group during the main working phase.
	This working phase runs from ??.2013 to ??.2014
	\section{Definitions}
	 The following table displays some definitions, that will be used throughout this document.
	
	 \begin{tabular}[h]{|c|p{9.75cm}|}
	  \hline
	  Term & Definition \\
	  \hline
	  \hline
	  Composite Component & Definition \\\hline
	  Component & A basic building block to generate music ??Haben wir uns hier auf Block als Bezeichnung geeinight? Component eher im Sinne von Softwarekomponente\\\hline
	  Editor & The Editor is used to create a patch out of components to generate synthesizable code which can be put on a FPGA \\\hline
	  FPGA & Field Programmable Gate Array \\\hline
	  Patch & The entire system which consists of Components and Composite Components. A set of single Components can build a new Component \\\hline
	  Port & The interface from one Component to another one \\\hline
	  Simulation & The developed patch is played through the PC speakers \\\hline
	 \end{tabular}
	 
	\section{Project outline}
	  - Creating an editor for synthesizers. 
	  - Components of the synthesizer implemented in hardware (and software for simulation purpose)
	  - Implementation of generative music concepts
	  ------- Warum wollen wir das eigentlich tun? Was ist die Motivation dahinter (zumal es das aus Oslo ja aschon in Software gibt)
	
	\section{Introduction to sound synthsis}
	  - Artifical generation of sound
	  - Generation of basic waveforms
	    - More complex and rich patterns by methods like additive/subtractive/... synth 
	  - Further addition of filters etc
	  
	  - Originated from analog synthesizers, nowadays mostly digital. Software for general purpose PCs exist
	  
	  - Building patches: job of a sound designer, rather than a musician
	  
	\section{Introduction to generative music}
	  - Creatioin of music depending on user interaction
	  - Users do not need to be musicians
	  - Playful approach to making music
	  - tightly connected to sound synthesis
	  
	\section{Employed systems}
	  \subsection{VHDL}
	    - Hardware components implemented in VHDL
	  \subsection{ReconOS}
	    - Developed at the University of Paderborn
	    - Operating system running on a softcore alongside our VHDL components
	    - Especially useful for integration of external devices (generative music)
	  \subsection{Eclipse/GMF}
	    - Synthesizer Editor developed as an Eclipse Plugin.
	    - Will use GMF
