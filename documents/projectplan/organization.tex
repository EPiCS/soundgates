\chapter{Organization}
Basically we split our group in two teams. The one team is the Software Team and the other the Hardware team.
The affilation to one of these teams is based on the previous experiences of the specific person.
-- 1 or 2 manager for special tasks, timing/deadlines and team coordination?

\section{Agile inspired development}
The following reasons inspired the agile-like development process that we discussed in the last section:

\begin{itemize}
\item Testing is an integrated part of the whole development process, which improves the
quality of the project.
\item Incremental development of the features by the iterative nature of agile software
development
\item Regular release of a working project code at the end of each iteration.
\item Easy adaptation for any change in circumstances.
\item Self organizing development process provides more team member involvement and
friendly environment.
\item Less end to end project overhead is required.
\end{itemize}

\section{Meetings}
Since the beginning of our project group we have a mandatory team meeting every week.
Right now it is scheduled each Monday at six o'clock.

The mandatory meeting is attended by all members of the group.
In this meeting the current status of all tasks and the whole project is discussed.
Further tasks for the next week are developed by discussion among the team members.
The members also track the progress towards the approaching milestone on each of this mandatory meetings.
Tasks are created and the members are assigned to the tasks in this meeting. Tasks assignment is either done due to volunteering or by asking a member.
A member with knowledge about a given task by previous experience or a seminar topic is  more likely assigned to that task.

\todo{Additionally time slot, when}

Furthermore a single person or a subgroup consisting of two or maximal three members that is working on a certain task is given a time slot where he/they can work on the provided computers and FPGAs.
The time slot must be kept by the person or the subgroup in order to ensure project progress and a controlled work flow.
Each member or subgroup has at least one time slot per week such that every group member is working each work on the project.
